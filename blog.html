                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    It is nearly time for my first day of class at DigitalCrafts in Atlanta!  I could not be more excited.  I have been working diligently on the prescribed prep work for the course for about two months, and I can honestly say that I have done as much as I possibly could to be prepared for this undertaking.  Now, it is time to get started and apply all of the prep work to begin learning at a faster and more focused pace, and building some awesome stuff.  Thanks to COVID-19, classes will be online for the first few weeks which I'm positive will be great.  Four more days of prep until my first day of school.

                    <h3>Monday, March 16, 2020 - What the World Needs Now</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    When I am not coding, I am generating a (modest) income as a DoorDasher.  I quit my full-time job a couple of months ago, which is a topic for its own post sometime in the near future.  Tonight, while delivering meals, it occured to me how prevalent isolation is with so many people in quarantine and working from home.  The fear and uncertainty of our current predicament combined with isolation and loneliness can easily result in an imagination that runs wild, playing out the scariest scenarios imaginable.  However, what I have found is that most people I deliver to are friendly and greet me with a smile.  They are warm and ask how I'm doing.  Tonight, I realized it is important, now more than ever, to reciprocate this attitude; to greet people with warmth and compassion, not fear and aversion.  We are all in this together, and we will all get through this together.  We must be aware that as humans isolate, they need love, warmth, and encouragement more than ever.  We are, after all, social creatures.  Let's make sure we do not lose our civility in these desperate times.  A smile, a "How are you doing?", a knowing glance towards a stranger...these small acts of solidarity have a huge impact on isolated and scared human beings.  Let's be kind to one another, and keep one another afloat in this sea of uncertainty.

                    <h3>Wednesday, March 11, 2020 - My First Post</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    Hello World! This is my first blog post...ever.  It feels great to begin my journey as a contributer on the Internet instead of solely a consumer.  I started building this website in preparation for the Full Stack Engineering bootcamp I will be attending later this month @ DigitalCrafts.  My goal is to blog about my coding journey and my experiences as a student at DigitalCrafts, and share with you all the things I learn along the way.  I hope to provide you all with good content; expect to see many changes and improvements to this site as I pick up new skills on my journey.  I'm looking forward to the future and I hope you are as well.  So long for now.
