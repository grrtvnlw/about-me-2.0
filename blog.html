                    <h3>Sunday, May 17, 2020 - Summary of Weeks 5 & 6</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    We continued working with JavaScript in Week 5, incorporating libraries such as jQuery to enhance our ability to manipulate the DOM and to add effects to specific elements. Towards the end of the week, we ventured into APIs and local browser storage.  I built my first app using an API, specifically the OMDb API.  My app was called Scene It, and it allows the user to search the OMDb API for any movie and add that movie to their watchlist, which is saved in their local browser storage.  We used some awesome technologies for this project, including jQuery and Axios.  The project was an invaluable teaching tool for learning how to make API requests and how to handle the JSON data coming back in the response; we used Bootstrap to help format the data and to build render functions using template strings.  The project was an absolute blast and served as a great springboard for our first team project in Week 6 which I will write about in the next blog post.

                    <h3>Monday, April 27, 2020 - Summary of Week 4...JavaScript!</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    Week 4 of class at DigitalCrafts was all about user interaction and fundamentals of JavaScript.  The week began with a conversation regarding the differences between JavaScript and Python: loosely typed language vs. strongly typed language, type coercion in JavaScript, objects, etc.  We moved into discussions about the DOM and BOM and covered DOM manipulation, DOM trees and document, element, attribute, and text nodes.  We implemented event listeners and event handlers, callback functions, and JavaScript methods such as .map and .forEach.  By the end of the week, we were diving into more advanced topics such as event propagation, bubbling, and abstraction.  On Friday, we studied sorting algorithms for bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.  This week was a valuable learning experience for me as I was able to understand the fundamentals of concepts I had previously only been aware of.  In Week 5 we will implement libraries such as Bootstrap and jQuery, and work with AJAX and getting data from websites.

                    <h3>Monday, April 20, 2020 - Summary of Week 3</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    Week 3 of class introduced us to Front-End Fundamentals.  We started off the week working with HTML and CSS, and by the end of the week we were studying responsive design principles using Flexbox.  We built two responsive layouts using HTML and CSS - replicas of the Google homepage and a Medium blog post.  On Friday, we discussed Big O Notation which was an entirely new concept for me and something I greatly enjoyed learning.  As I learn more about programming, I want to understand the why just as much as the how.  I want to learn the sleekest, most efficient way to write algorithms, creating algorithms that use the least amount of operations and memory.  Today, the first day of Week 4, we start JavaScript.  Onward!

                    <h3>Saturday, April 11, 2020 - First Two Weeks of Class</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    The first 2 weeks of class at DigitalCrafts have come and gone, and what a couple of weeks they have been.  So far, my experience has been outstanding.  We've moved at a rapid pace, beginning Week 1 with Bash, CLI, and basic Git and GitHub before moving on to Python at the end of the week.  In Week 2 we quickly advanced from loops and conditional statements to navigating dictionaries and lists and then on to fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.  We spend a lot of time coding in class; we've built several small games and for every new concept we're taught, there is a relevant coding exercise to reinforce the subject.  Furthermore, each Friday is devoted to career prep, where we have discussed everything from the technical interview process, resume prep, and whiteboarding.  We've practiced whiteboarding with algorithms such as the FizzBuzz Challenge and Fibonacci Sequence (Week 1) and tracking letter frequency in a string and comparing the frequency of specific integers in 2 different lists (Week 2).  Throughout the entire course I've met some truly incredible, intelligent, kind, and humble people.  Every one of my classmates, instructors, and administrative staff have been supportive, encouraging, and positive.  What a tremendous environment to be a part of and I can't wait to see what's in store for the next 3 1/2 months.

                    <h3>Wednesday, March 25, 2020 - Right Around the Corner</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    It is nearly time for my first day of class at DigitalCrafts in Atlanta!  I could not be more excited.  I have been working diligently on the prescribed prep work for the course for about two months, and I can honestly say that I have done as much as I possibly could to be prepared for this undertaking.  Now, it is time to get started and apply all of the prep work to begin learning at a faster and more focused pace, and building some awesome stuff.  Thanks to COVID-19, classes will be online for the first few weeks which I'm positive will be great.  Four more days of prep until my first day of school.

                    <h3>Monday, March 16, 2020 - What the World Needs Now</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    When I am not coding, I am generating a (modest) income as a DoorDasher.  I quit my full-time job a couple of months ago, which is a topic for its own post sometime in the near future.  Tonight, while delivering meals, it occured to me how prevalent isolation is with so many people in quarantine and working from home.  The fear and uncertainty of our current predicament combined with isolation and loneliness can easily result in an imagination that runs wild, playing out the scariest scenarios imaginable.  However, what I have found is that most people I deliver to are friendly and greet me with a smile.  They are warm and ask how I'm doing.  Tonight, I realized it is important, now more than ever, to reciprocate this attitude; to greet people with warmth and compassion, not fear and aversion.  We are all in this together, and we will all get through this together.  We must be aware that as humans isolate, they need love, warmth, and encouragement more than ever.  We are, after all, social creatures.  Let's make sure we do not lose our civility in these desperate times.  A smile, a "How are you doing?", a knowing glance towards a stranger...these small acts of solidarity have a huge impact on isolated and scared human beings.  Let's be kind to one another, and keep one another afloat in this sea of uncertainty.    
                    </p>
                    <h3>Wednesday, March 11, 2020 - My First Post</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    Hello World! This is my first blog post...ever.  It feels great to begin my journey as a contributer on the Internet instead of solely a consumer.  I started building this website in preparation for the Full Stack Engineering bootcamp I will be attending later this month @ DigitalCrafts.  My goal is to blog about my coding journey and my experiences as a student at DigitalCrafts, and share with you all the things I learn along the way.  I hope to provide you all with good content; expect to see many changes and improvements to this site as I pick up new skills on my journey.  I'm looking forward to the future and I hope you are as well.  So long for now.
