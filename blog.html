                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    Hello World! This is my first blog post...ever.  It feels great to begin my journey as a contributer on the Internet instead of solely a consumer.  I started building this website in preparation for the Full Stack Engineering bootcamp I will be attending later this month @ DigitalCrafts.  My goal is to blog about my coding journey and my experiences as a student at DigitalCrafts, and share with you all the things I learn along the way.  I hope to provide you all with good content; expect to see many changes and improvements to this site as I pick up new skills on my journey.  I'm looking forward to the future and I hope you are as well.  So long for now.
