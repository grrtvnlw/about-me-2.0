                    <h3>Monday, April 20, 2020 - Summary of Week 3</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    Week 3 of class introduced us to Front-End Fundamentals.  We started off the week working with HTML and CSS, and by the end of the week we were studying responsive design principles using Flexbox.  We built two responsive layouts using HTML and CSS - replicas of the Google homepage and a Medium blog post.  On Friday, we discussed Big O Notation which was an entirely new concept for me and something I greatly enjoyed learning.  As I learn more about programming, I want to understand the why just as much as the how.  I want to learn the sleekest, most efficient way to write algorithms, creating algorithms that use the least amount of operations and memory.  Today, the first day of Week 4, we start JavaScript.  Onward!

                    <h3>Saturday, April 11, 2020 - First Two Weeks of Class</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    The first 2 weeks of class at DigitalCrafts have come and gone, and what a couple of weeks they have been.  So far, my experience has been outstanding.  We've moved at a rapid pace, beginning Week 1 with Bash, CLI, and basic Git and GitHub before moving on to Python at the end of the week.  In Week 2 we quickly advanced from loops and conditional statements to navigating dictionaries and lists and then on to fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.  We spend a lot of time coding in class; we've built several small games and for every new concept we're taught, there is a relevant coding exercise to reinforce the subject.  Furthermore, each Friday is devoted to career prep, where we have discussed everything from the technical interview process, resume prep, and whiteboarding.  We've practiced whiteboarding with algorithms such as the FizzBuzz Challenge and Fibonacci Sequence (Week 1) and tracking letter frequency in a string and comparing the frequency of specific integers in 2 different lists (Week 2).  Throughout the entire course I've met some truly incredible, intelligent, kind, and humble people.  Every one of my classmates, instructors, and administrative staff have been supportive, encouraging, and positive.  What a tremendous environment to be a part of and I can't wait to see what's in store for the next 3 1/2 months.

                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    It is nearly time for my first day of class at DigitalCrafts in Atlanta!  I could not be more excited.  I have been working diligently on the prescribed prep work for the course for about two months, and I can honestly say that I have done as much as I possibly could to be prepared for this undertaking.  Now, it is time to get started and apply all of the prep work to begin learning at a faster and more focused pace, and building some awesome stuff.  Thanks to COVID-19, classes will be online for the first few weeks which I'm positive will be great.  Four more days of prep until my first day of school.

                    <h3>Monday, March 16, 2020 - What the World Needs Now</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    When I am not coding, I am generating a (modest) income as a DoorDasher.  I quit my full-time job a couple of months ago, which is a topic for its own post sometime in the near future.  Tonight, while delivering meals, it occured to me how prevalent isolation is with so many people in quarantine and working from home.  The fear and uncertainty of our current predicament combined with isolation and loneliness can easily result in an imagination that runs wild, playing out the scariest scenarios imaginable.  However, what I have found is that most people I deliver to are friendly and greet me with a smile.  They are warm and ask how I'm doing.  Tonight, I realized it is important, now more than ever, to reciprocate this attitude; to greet people with warmth and compassion, not fear and aversion.  We are all in this together, and we will all get through this together.  We must be aware that as humans isolate, they need love, warmth, and encouragement more than ever.  We are, after all, social creatures.  Let's make sure we do not lose our civility in these desperate times.  A smile, a "How are you doing?", a knowing glance towards a stranger...these small acts of solidarity have a huge impact on isolated and scared human beings.  Let's be kind to one another, and keep one another afloat in this sea of uncertainty.

                    <h3>Wednesday, March 11, 2020 - My First Post</h3>
                    <p class="blog-entry">
                    Hello World! This is my first blog post...ever.  It feels great to begin my journey as a contributer on the Internet instead of solely a consumer.  I started building this website in preparation for the Full Stack Engineering bootcamp I will be attending later this month @ DigitalCrafts.  My goal is to blog about my coding journey and my experiences as a student at DigitalCrafts, and share with you all the things I learn along the way.  I hope to provide you all with good content; expect to see many changes and improvements to this site as I pick up new skills on my journey.  I'm looking forward to the future and I hope you are as well.  So long for now.
